# Celestidesk
Basic idea is: you create a request as a employee. It gets escalated to the teamlead. It is further escalated to the manager. If approved, the employee sees it in his approved list. Else in rejected list.
Uses this [beautiful backend](https://github.com/niyasrad/CelestiDesk-BE) by @niyasrad 

Multiple person can function under a specific role, and they can collectively approve or deny requests.
An option for emergency request is given. Because, unavoidable situations do occur.

There are 4 Roles: `EMPLOYEE`, `TEAM_LEAD`, `MANAGER` and `EMERGENCY`

# Motivation
To eliminate the need for writing a letter, and getting it signed by faculties for the permission to leave the hostel. Yea, it's a one heck of work, and to maintain those paper records are another headache for the faculties.
Now, with one click, the request can be granted, and it's all well recorded and mailed to authorities every month. Students can now show the approved requests to the appropriate person before leaving the campus.
And yea, you can't cheat, I will stricken out the expired requests ðŸ¤­ so it is obvious.
